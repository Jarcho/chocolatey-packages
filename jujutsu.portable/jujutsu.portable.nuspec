    <summary>Jujutsu is a version control system that separates the user interface from the storage system.</summary>
    <description><![CDATA[Jujutsu is a powerful [version control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control)
for software projects. You use it to get a copy of your code, track changes
to the code, and finally publish those changes for others to see and use.
It is designed from the ground up to be easy to use—whether you're new or
experienced, working on brand new projects alone, or large scale software
projects with large histories and teams.

Jujutsu is unlike most other systems, because internally it abstracts the user
interface and version control algorithms from the *storage systems* used to
serve your content. This allows it to serve as a VCS with many possible physical
backends, that may have their own data or networking models—like [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/) or
[Breezy](https://www.breezy-vcs.org/), or hybrid systems like Google's cloud-based design, [Piper/CitC](https://youtu.be/W71BTkUbdqE?t=645).
